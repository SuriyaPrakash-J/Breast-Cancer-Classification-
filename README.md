# 📚 Project Overview:

This project aims to classify whether a tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using machine learning models. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
Using this classification model, we aim to assist in early detection based on clinical features.

# 🧩 Dataset:

Name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Features:

i)Mean, standard error, and worst values of attributes like radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, etc.
ii)Target classes:
iii)Benign (0)
iv)Malignant (1)

# ⚙️ Workflow:

Data Collection
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical labels
Feature scaling (Normalization/Standardization)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing correlations
Understanding feature distributions
Model Building
Splitting into Train/Test sets
Training multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
Model Evaluation
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Confusion Matrix
Model Tuning (Optional)
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV
Prediction and Deployment (Optional)

# 🛠 Technologies Used
-Python 🐍

-Libraries:
